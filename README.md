## Making GIF Pattern Animations in Python Matplotlib
This code was written by Eleanor Lutz to generate [this website](http://tabletopwhale.com/colorpalette.html). 

I learned Python a few months ago from the [UW Software Carpentry Course](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) and needed a practice project to work on. This is a script that makes a GIF illustration for any 5-unit color scheme. The script features five different animated patterns, all based on Islamic mosaics. 

There are probably a lot of mistakes in the code but I'm going to open source it anyway in case it's helpful for anyone else. Please feel free to use the script for whatever you like. I'd definitely appreciate comments if my use of Python is blatantly wrong somewhere.
